EasyRad:

<option> elements may embed templates (see MRRT: 8.1.3.5.1 Selection Items).
The identifier of the template to embed is specified in attribute data-template-UID,
The element in the calling template, which should be replaced with the embedded template,
is specified in attribute data-replacement-element-id.

Must be implemented.


============ 2017-06-06 ============

EasyRad:

Inline labels are not specified in MRRT: 8.1.3.2 Linkage Between Template Text 
and Template Fields.

Affected function:

js/converter.js: getElmLabelText(elm) 

This extension should be removed!




============ 2017-05-09 ============

EasyRad:

To allow temporary compatibility with templates, which do not follow MRRT strict
the following extension is implemented:

DIV elements are allowed and are handled during conversion to text in the same way as P elements.

Affected function:

js/converter.js: processElementNode(elm, text), 
js/converter.js: getElmValue(elm)

This extension should be removed!

All templates had to follow the MRRT specification.



============ 2017-05-09 ============

EasyRad:

MRRT specifies, that a Report Creator must use the value attribute of an OPTION 
element as its value. The value attribute and the text of an OPTION should be the same.

To allow temporary compatibility with templates, which do not follow MRRT strict
the following extension is implemented:

By the parameter

  USE_OPTION_TEXT = true; 

the text of an OPTION element is used as its value.

Affected function:

js/converter.js: getElmValue(elm)

This parameter is marked as "deprecated" and will be removed in following version.
EasyRad will use the value attribute instead.



============ 2017-05-09 ============

EasyRad Editor:

The following MRRT elements are still not available in the WYSIWYG mode of TinyMCE:

SPAN
HEADER
SELECT
OPTION
INPUT (all execpt type="textarea", which is replaced by TEXTAREA in the editor)
TEXTAREA

Corresponding plugins have to be programmed.

A starting point could be the form editor plugin for TinyMCE "JMForm plugin for TinyMCE".
Link: https://sourceforge.net/projects/jmforms/

In its latest version 2.0.2 the plugin is still not compatible with TinyMCE and 
needs an update!

Additionally TinyMCE has to extended to allow edting of element attribute values 
according to MRRT specification.



============ 2017-05-03 ============

EasyRad Editor:

The MRRT file format does not allow <textarea> elements. The functionality is
defined by <input type="textarea"> elements, which are NOT part of HTML 5.

To allow editing of a MRRT file, these elments may be replaced on the fly when
reading and witing a MRRT file.

This could be done in setupTemplateEditor(doc) and function updateTemplateDoc(),
both defined in /edit/js/index.js.
