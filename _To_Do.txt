W3C states that URLs of stylesheets must ALWAYS be relativ to the file they referre to.

Templates may import stylsheets with the <link> tag. It should be expected, that 
the URLs are specified relative to the template file.
On the other hand the template file is loaded into /easyrad/index.html. Therefore
the style must be specified relative to index.html.

=> When loading the template the URLs of the <link> tag should be adopted on the fly.

<embed> tags in template files are ignored when loading the file.

? => Force a redraw the window: $(...).hide().show(0); or $(window).trigger('resize');

? => Replace the <embed> tag on the fly with the embedded HTML content (recursive)

Images referenced in an <img> tag are not rendered as image, but with the alternative
 text.
