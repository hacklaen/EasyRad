EasyRad Editor:

The following MRRT elements are still not available in the WYSIWYG mode of TinyMCE:

SPAN
HEADER
SELECT
OPTION
INPUT (all execpt type="textarea", which is replaced by TEXTAREA in the editor)
TEXTAREA

Corresponding plugins have to be programmed.

A starting point could be the form editor plugin for TinyMCE "JMForm plugin for TinyMCE".
Link: https://sourceforge.net/projects/jmforms/

In its latest version 2.0.2 the plugin is still not compatible with TinyMCE and 
needs an update!

Additionally TinyMCE has to extended to allow edting of element attribute values 
according to MRRT specification.

EasyRad Editor:

The MRRT file format does not allow <textarea> elements. The functionality is
defined by <input type="textarea"> elements, which are NOT part of HTML 5.

To allow editing of a MRRT file, these elments may be replaced on the fly when
reading and witing a MRRT file.

This could be done in setupTemplateEditor(doc) and function updateTemplateDoc(),
both defined in /edit/js/index.js.
