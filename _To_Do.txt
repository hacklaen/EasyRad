EasyRad:

MRRT specifies, that a Report Creator must use the value attribute of an OPTION 
element as its value. The value attribute and the text of an OPTION should be the same.

To allow temporary compatibility with templates, which do not follow MRRT strict
the following extension is implemented:

By the parameter

  USE_OPTION_TEXT = true; 

the text of an OPTION element is as its value.

Affected function:

js/converter.js: getElmValue(elm)

This parameter is marked as "deprecated" and will be removed in following version.
EasyRad will use the value attribute instead.

EasyRad:

To allow temporary compatibility with templates, which do not follow MRRT strict
the following extension is implemented:

DIV elements are allowed and are handled during conversion to text in the same way as P elements.

Affected function:

js/converter.js: processElementNode(elm, text), 
js/converter.js: getElmValue(elm)

This extension should be removed!

All templates had to follow the MRRT specification.

EasyRad Editor:

The following MRRT elements are still not available in the WYSIWYG mode of TinyMCE:

SPAN
HEADER
SELECT
OPTION
INPUT (all execpt type="textarea", which is replaced by TEXTAREA in teh editor)
TEXTAREA

Corresponding plugins have to be programmed.

A starting point could be the form editor plugin for TinyMCE "JMForm plugin for TinyMCE".
Link: https://sourceforge.net/projects/jmforms/

In its latest version 2.0.2 the plugin is still not compatible with TinyMCE and 
needs an update!

Additionally TinyMCE has to extended to allow edting of element attribute values 
according to MRRT specification.

EasyRad Editor:

Loading of a template to edit at startup using the parameter "easyrad_param_template_to_edit".

This works well, if EasyRad Edit runs on a server, but not, if index.html is loaded
from the local filesystem in the browser.

Problem with access rights?

Problem in specifying the path?
var easyrad_param_template_to_edit = 'file:///C:/Users/Tom/Desktop/EasyRad/EasyRadEdit_Project/GitHub/EasyRad/easyrad/samples/IHE_MRRT_Example_TI_TH.html';

EasyRad Editor:

The MRRT file format does not allow <textarea> elements. The functionality is
defined by <input type="textarea"> elements, which are NOT part of HTML 5.

To allow editing of a MRRT file, these elments may be replaced on the fly when
reading and witing a MRRT file.

This could be done in setupTemplateEditor(doc) and function updateTemplateDoc(),
both defined in /edit/js/index.js.

EasyRad:

W3C states that URLs of stylesheets must ALWAYS be relativ to the file they referre to.

Templates may import stylsheets with the <link> tag. It should be expected, that 
the URLs are specified relative to the template file.
On the other hand the template file is loaded into /easyrad/index.html. Therefore
the style must be specified relative to index.html.

=> When loading the template the URLs of the <link> tag should be adopted on the fly.


============ 2017-04-23 ============

EasyRad:

<embed> tags in template files are ignored when loading the file.

? => Force a redraw the window: $(...).hide().show(0); or $(window).trigger('resize');

? => Replace the <embed> tag on the fly with the embedded HTML content (recursive)

EasyRad:

Images referenced in an <img> tag are not rendered as image, but with the alternative
 text.

? => Force a redraw the window: $(...).hide().show(0); or $(window).trigger('resize');
